	* jadetex.dtx: version 3.11
	* jadetex.dtx: patches for multiple columns from Jean-Marie Kubek
	<kubek@insa-tlse.fr> 

2001-07-13  Sebastian Rahtz  <sebastian.rahtz@computing-services.oxford.ac.uk>
	* jadetex.dtx: version 3.10
	* jadetex.dtx: changed \if#1{qqq} to \ifx#1\@qqq, stupid mistake
	by me

2001-07-11  Sebastian Rahtz  <sebastian.rahtz@computing-services.oxford.ac.uk>
	* jadetex.dtx: version 3.9
	* jadetex.dtx: undefined page labels now "qqq" instead of -999,
	because pages can now be non-numeric (eg "ii"), and the \ifnum
	test could not work (from Ian Castle
	<bb+lists.docbook-apps@looksystems.co.uk>) 

2001-06-23  Sebastian Rahtz  <sebastian.rahtz@computing-services.oxford.ac.uk>

	* jadetex.dtx: version 3.8
	From: Richard Sharpe <sharpe@ns.aus.com>
          small patch  to ensure that there is no 
          ugly space before or after a Rule.

2001-06-22  Sebastian Rahtz  <sebastian.rahtz@computing-services.oxford.ac.uk>

	* version 3.7
	* patches from Francis J. Lacoste
	  <francis.lacoste@Contre.COM>

        * mlnames.sty: There seems to be a problem with certain tetex
	installation where
        the name francais isn't defined. Change it back to french which is
        always supported.

        *jadetex.dtx:

        * Add a \noindent before the leaders so that they always work.

        * Make margins specification compliant with the DSSSL semantics.

        * Somewhat fixes the white space problem in the
	footnotes. Inter-line and inter-paragraph spacing wasn't
	working. This improves it a little bit, but
        it's still not perfect.

        * Fix a bug that prevent simple-page-sequence to be labelled (made
	 some table of content generation failed)

        * It was possible for -999 page number to crept in the table of
	content. Fixed.

        * Implement inline graphic as per the DSSSL spec. Limited
	implementation of layer property : object with layer > 1 overdraw
	the text. This makes some superposition effects possible.

        * Implement all possible rule (inline and display, horizontal and
	vertical). Limited implementation of the layer property.
	

2001-03-28  Sebastian Rahtz  <sebastian.rahtz@computing-services.oxford.ac.uk>

	* version 3.4, 3.5, 3.6: fixing errors in macros related to
	odd/even page setup

2001-02-01  Sebastian Rahtz  <sebastian.rahtz@computing-services.oxford.ac.uk>
        version 3.3
	* jadetex.dtx: make \Link look at \LinkType property

2001-01-18  Sebastian Rahtz  <sebastian.rahtz@computing-services.oxford.ac.uk>
        Version 3.2
	* jadetex.dtx: make a DisplayGroup set a link

2001-01-17  Sebastian Rahtz  <sebastian.rahtz@computing-services.oxford.ac.uk>

	* jadetex.dtx: make twoside the default again (can still be turned off)

2001-01-10  Sebastian Rahtz  <sebastian.rahtz@computing-services.oxford.ac.uk>

	* jadetex.dtx: remove Babel dependency, and pick up alternate code
	from mlnames.sty (shared with PassiveTeX)

2001-01-09  Sebastian Rahtz  <sebastian.rahtz@oucs.ox.ac.uk>

       * fix Norwegian language support (from Tore Morkemo <tore@bibsyst.no>)
       * loads of patches from 	 http://indev.insu.com/openjade/ , 
	communicated by Thomas Andre Berger <thomasbe@osc.no> (not sure who 
	did the work).
      
      * twoside optional characteristic
       JadeTeX turns on the twoside LaTeX
	 feature by default. Make it optional  by using an extension 
	 characteristics (needs patched openjade)

      * cell-*-row-margin support
       JadeTeX support for the 
	 cell-before-row-margin and cell-after-row-margin
	wasn't working properly. 

      
      * Sequence in table support
       
	JadeTeX wasn't handling sequence in table cells 
	 properly. If you used a sequence to typeset a word in italic, the rest
	of the cell was also typeset in italic.
      
      * multipar removal
       This patch removes the unused multipar macro from 
	 JadeTex.

      * Better table support
       Those patches makes the support for tables in the TeX
	 backend a lot better (needs openjade patch too)
	
	
	 Support for nested tables.
	 cell-after-column-margin: and cell-before-column-margin:
                 wasn't really working.
	 Row spanning was broken. This patch only supports 'start
	 row alignment though.
	 Paragraphs in cell spanning multiple column are now working.
	 Support for the row-alignment: characteristic.
	 Support for cell-background? and background-color properties
      
       * Trailing page bug fix
       JadeTeX was always outputting an extra blank page. 
	 This patch solves this problem.
      
       * Support for 'asis and 'asis-wrap
       Those patches adds support for the 'asis and
	 'asis-wrap values for the paragraph's lines:
	characteristic.

       * Support for 'background-color box's characteristic
       This patch adds support for the 'background-color
	characteristic of the box sosofo object.
	
       * Support for more fonts with long name
       This patch adds  windows like alias for the fonts Monospace821, 
	 Humanist521 and NewsGothic.

	   labelling

	 \displaygroup now does setupics in a table cell

2000-03-26  Sebastian Rahtz  <sebastian.rahtz@oucs.ox.ac.uk>

	* jadetex.dtx: fixes by Simon Pepping
 	   a) to indentation after display math
	   b) to treatment of left and right in fences
	   c) to the way multiple columns are worked out
	* monkeying around with tables, trying (not 100% successfully)
	  to solve the outstanding errors
	* clean error in reading ucharacters.sty
	* manually set up characters 32-126

1999-12-30  Sebastian Rahtz  <sebastian.rahtz@oucs.ox.ac.uk>

	* jadetex.dtx: math mode should be display by default, not inline
	(Matthias Clasen)

1999-12-17  Sebastian Rahtz  <sebastian.rahtz@computing-services.oxford.ac.uk>

	and multicols)

1999-06-29  Sebastian Rahtz  <sebastian.rahtz@oucs.ox.ac.uk>

        RELEASE 2.7
	* jadetex.dtx: J.-M. Kubek (kubek@insa-tlse.fr) supplied patches
	to support \HeadPar, for PDF bookmarks


1999-05-12  Sebastian Rahtz  <sebastian.rahtz@oucs.ox.ac.uk>

        RELEASE 2.6
	* jadetex.dtx: removed \@begindocumenthook from \FOT. fouls up
	pdftex. not even sure why it was there

1998-12-15  Sebastian Rahtz  <s.rahtz@elsevier.co.uk>

	* jadetex.dtx: move read of jadetex.cfg to end of \FOT

Sun Oct 18 22:51:35 1998  Sebastian Rahtz  <s.rahtz@elsevier.co.uk>

	* RELEASE 2.3 (maybe test only)
	* jadetex.dtx: more vertical space changes. call \the\everypar at
	end of Displaynic and start of endDisplayNIC. Desparation. forget
	flags. forget conditional calls to useJadevskip. scream.

Sat Oct 17 15:09:41 1998  Sebastian Rahtz  <s.rahtz@elsevier.co.uk>

	* jadetex.dtx: an infinity of changes to get vertical space right
	with much help from David Carlisle.
	The algorithm now is
	a) at start of DisplayGroup:
	   1. if flag set, use Jadeskip
	   2. set Jadeskip to computed above-space; set flag
        b) at end of DisplayGroup, set Jadeskip to 
	          computed below-space; set flag
	c) at \everypar, use Jadeskip
	d) at use Jadeskip, unset flag

this means that the Jadeskip space is replaced each time, and normally
activated by everypar, but it is also activated by hand when a new
display object starts; this makes \par\par\par have the right behaviour

	probably make no difference.

Mon Sep 28 14:41:04 1998  Sebastian Rahtz  <s.rahtz@elsevier.co.uk>
