	* jadetex.dtx, ucharacters.sty, uentities.sty: Add support for euro
	symbol and &euro; entity
	
	This provides higher quality euro symbol support using the
	PostScript font provided by the marvosym package (instead of the TC
	font). There is now a dependancy on the marvosym package as a
	result.
	
	In addition the &euro; entity is now supported.

	* mlnames.sty: sf.net request 452537 Add extra fonts
	
	Added a variety of extra fonts (also from the mandrakesoft
	configuration).  Of course, you will need these fonts installed if
	you want to use them!

	* jadetex.dtx: Red Hat bugzilla bug 47345
	
	https://bugzilla.redhat.com/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=47345
	
	Long Directory path goes off the page: If there is a long directory
	path in a document it goes off the side of the page.  Long
	pathnames should be split or put on a separate line so that they
	don't go off the edge of the page.  Added
	'\setlength\emergencystretch{2in}'. In case of overfull hboxes, an
	extra stretchable length gets added to the end of the lines.

	* Makefile: Make makefile more friendly for packagers with
	introduction of DESTDIR environment variable. This change is
	transparent to those that don't want to use DESTDIR.

	* jadetex.dtx: Applied sf patch #492522
	
	Fix unbalanced multi columns: the TeX multicol package supports
	both balanced and unbalanced columns.  However, jadetex 3.11
	doesn't call the functions for unbalanced columns correctly.  Since
	a bug in the handling of %page-balanced-columns?% was fixed in
	3.11, this is now the common case - so multicolumn documents that
	used to work in 3.10 no longer work...

	* jadetex.dtx: Apply sf patch #470586
	
	Fix for ext-graphics rendering: ExternalGraphic is centered within
	\textwidth instead of \columnwidth, causing bad placement in
	multicolumn mode.

2002-01-07 11:45  icastle

	* jadetex.dtx: Add patch #444445 from source forge.
	
	Fix for space above horizontal rule: Not all of the patch detailed
	in http://sources.redhat.com/ml/docbook-apps/2001-q2/msg00352.html
	made it in to jadetex.	The \nointerlineskip to supress blank space
	above a horizontal rule is missing.

	* doc/install.sgm: Minor corrections

2002-01-07 11:31  icastle

	* doc/: .cvsignore, Makefile, demo.tex, docbook.dsl, install.log,
	install.pdf, install.sgm, install.tex: Reinstate "install.sgm".
	Remove output files from cvs. Make "Makefile" more generic so it
	will build in a standard environment. Add .cvsignore so that
	openjade/pdftex output files are not checked in.
